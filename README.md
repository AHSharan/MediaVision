# MediaVision
MediaVision is a Python application that leverages MediaPipe and OpenCV for hand gesture recognition to control media playback and system volume. Using a webcam, the program detects specific hand gestures to perform actions such as play/pause, next track, previous track, and volume adjustment.
## Features
- Play/Pause: Tap the thumb and middle finger together to play or pause the media.
- Next Track: Swipe your thumb to the right while maintaining a specific hand gesture to skip to the next track.
- Previous Track: Swipe your thumb to the left while maintaining a specific hand gesture to go to the previous track.
- Volume Control: Adjust the system volume by moving your hand up and down while holding a gesture.
